# Zomato-Analysis-Dashboard

As we all know, @Zomato is one of the most popular food delivery and restaurant discovery platforms in the world. I wanted to explore the data available on Zomato and see what insights I could uncover.

After diving into the data, I was able to answer some interesting questions, such as:

🍴 What are the most popular cuisines in different cities, countries?

🌶️ How do the ratings of restaurants vary based on the type of cuisine they serve?

🏪 What are the most commonly searched for restaurants in each city, country?

🕰️ When is the best time to visit a restaurant based on its ratings?
and many more....

By visualizing the data using Tableau,PowerBI, I was able to create an interactive Dashboard that provides insights on all these questions and more! 🤓

I would love to hear your thoughts on my Zomato analysis dashboard. What other questions do you think we could answer using this data?
